# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React, likely using Next.js given the folder structure.

## Component Organization

- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components organized by feature:
  - `assessments/` - Components for assessment functionality
  - `companies/` - Company management components
  - `courses/` - Course-related components
  - `dashboard/` - Dashboard visualization components
  - `employees/` - Employee management components
  - `layouts/` - Page layout components
  - `schedules/` - Schedule management components
  - `trainers/` - Trainer profile components
  - `ui/` - Generic UI components
  - `shared/` - Cross-cutting components

## Page Structure

- `src/pages/` - Route-based page components:
  - `companies/` - Company management pages
  - `courses/` - Course management pages
  - `employees/` - Employee management pages
  - `schedules/` - Schedule management pages
  - `settings/` - Application settings
  - `trainers/` - Trainer management pages

## Data Flow

- API communication is likely handled through `src/api/` and `src/services/`
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` provide reusable logic
- Type definitions in `src/types/` ensure type safety
