# Backend Architecture

The backend is organized in a Node.js application with Prisma ORM for database access.

## Key Components

- `backend/prisma/` - Database schema
  - Italian terminology is used for some entities (e.g., "Aziende" for companies)

- `backend/routes/` - API endpoints and route handlers
  - Organized around entity types (employees, courses, etc.)

- `backend/generated/prisma/` - Auto-generated Prisma client code

## File Storage

- `backend/uploads/` - File storage for uploaded documents:
  - `attestati/` - Certificate documents
  - `templates/` - Document templates

## Database Structure

The database schema supports:
- Employee and trainer management
- Course scheduling and attendance tracking
- Company and department organization
- Document generation with templates
- Various document types with specific metadata
